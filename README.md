# Segway
This repository will hold code for robots balancing on two wheels, made with various robotics platforms.

This code will eventually supersede all of the programs for balancing robots currently available on [Robotsquare] (http://robotsquare.com). If you're not sure how to use this code, please refer to the existing code and associated tutorials for now.

## Currently available platforms

LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 (ev3dev with Python 2 and 3):

- [Building instructions] (http://robotsquare.com/2014/06/23/tutorial-building-balanc3r/)
- Add a Touch Sensor to Port 1. I added it just like the Gyro, but on the other side of the brick. This will be the program's safe stop button.


## Work in progress

- VEX IQ (RobotC): Completed, to be released soon
- LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 (EV3-G):  Currently available in legacy segway code
- LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 (RobotC): Awaiting some gyro issues with RobotC
- LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT (RobotC): Currently available in legacy segway code
- LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT (NXT-G):  Currently available in legacy segway code
